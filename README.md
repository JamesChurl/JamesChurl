### Hello! 🤠

My name is James and this is my first GitHub repository. It is a place to store some small projects and tiny python games I've either made myself from tutorials or taken from other people's repositories and tweaked to suit my liking. 

I am a data analyst and cyber security engineering professional. My passions lie in teaching and creativity. Some of my other interest include playing piano, yoga and pilates, history, and film and television.
