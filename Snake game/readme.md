## Snake and Apple Game
Building a snake game in `pygame and python`

Snake and apple is a simple game where when the snake eats an apple it gets longer and your score increases. If the snake hits any part of its body or the boundaries it will die.

### Exercise

1. Add a logic to end the game if snake hits any of the wall boundaries of main screen. 
Here you need to check the position of your head and see if it goes beyond window boundaries (1000,800). 
If it does, game should end in same way as we end it when snake collides with itself.

2. Try increasing the speed of the snake to make the game a little more challenging.  Reduce the sleep time to 0.1 sec to achieve this.
